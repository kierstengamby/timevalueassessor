Time Value Assessor App

The purpose of this app is to allow users to assess the value of their "neutral time" (i.e. time spent doing regular tasks outside of work) in order to determine if it would be more advantageous to outsource and pay a service provider for task completion, or continue to do the task(s) themselves.

This client is written in React - Legacy, using Class Components, lifecycle methods, and state management. 

Users are able to register and login using email and password credentials that are authenticated against the backend database. Users will only be able to access their own information, unless they have admin access. Users can log their hourly wage and neutral value (which can be found using the ClearerThinking assessment). They can use the stopwatch provided or another available time-monitoring device to track the time they spend in each listed task category. After they track a week of tasks, they should use the Value Calculator to determine the average dollar per hour they are spending in each category and compare that to their neutral value.

This app is styled with CSS and Reactstrap and is deployed through Heroku.
